Question 1
Functions are advantageous when performing a repeated task.They save time because a function can be created for the repeated task and only require the programmer to make an input.Functions make programming relatively simpler,faster and less tedious for programmers

Question 2
```{r}
#Let x be the observed value,a the mean and b the standard deviation
z_score=function(x,a,b)
{(x-a)/b
  return((x-a)/b)
} 
z_score(25.77,23.54,2.442)
```

Question 3
```{r}
#Let m be the given number and n the prime number
mfunc=function(m,n)
  {(log(m)*log10(m))/n**(1/3)
return((log(m)*log10(m))/n**(1/3))
}
mfunc(32,11)
round(mfunc(32,11),digits = 1)

```
Question 4
```{r}
sdmtcars <- vector("double", ncol(mtcars)) 
 for (i in seq_along(mtcars)) {             
   sdmtcars[[i]] <- sd(mtcars[[i]])         
 }
sdmtcars
```
