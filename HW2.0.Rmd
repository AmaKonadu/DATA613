library(dplyr)
```

Question 1
```{r}
a <- function(i) 
  {
  print (sum(log(i),log10(i),log2(i)))
}
#for (i in c(2,4,6,8,10)) {
 # print(a(i))
#}
a(2)
a(4)
a(6)
a(8)
a(10)
```
Question 2
Use the if-else structure to print the statement "This is a big number" if the square of a value 
is greater than or equal to 100 and the following statement is printed if the square of the 
number is less than 100, "This is not a big number”. Use and show values of assignment and if-
else structures that will output both statements
```{r}
e <- function(x) {
  if (x^2 > 100) {
    result <- "This is a big number"
  }
  else if (x^2 < 100) {
    result <- "This is not a big number"
  }
  else {
    result <- "This is a big number"
  }
  return(result)
  }
e(10)
e(9)
```
Question 3
```{r}
team_A <- 4 # Number of goals scored by Team A
team_B <- 2# Number of goals scored by Team B
if (team_A > team_B){
  print ("Team A won")
} else if (team_A < team_B){
  print ("Team B won")
} else {
  "Team A & B tied"
}
```
Question 4
 Write an if- else if- else sequence of commands that will output the following
statements and appropriate output; If a value is divisible by 3 and 5 the output
statement is "divisible by Three and Five", If a value is divisible by 3 and 4, 
the output statement is "divisible by Three and Four, If a value is a number that
does not fall into either category, the output statement should be  "neither".
Use your function to show output statements for values 16, 45, and 24.
```{r}
 r <- function(x) {
  if (x%%3==0  & x%%5==0  ) {
    result <- "divisible by Three and Five"
  }
  else if (x%%3==0  & x%%4==0 ) {
    result <- "divisible by Three and Four"
  }
  else {
    result <- "neither"
  }
  return(result)
 }
r(16)
r(45)
r(24)
```
Question 5
```{r}
mpg1 <- mpg%>%
        select(displ,cyl,cty,hwy)
mpg1
 output <- vector("double" ,ncol(mpg1))  
 for (i in seq_along(mpg1)) {            
   output[[i]] <- var(mpg1[[i]])      
 }
 output
```
Question 6
Construct a for loop (as illustrated in the notes) that will produce the difference between the 
cube and the square for each prime number between 10 and 30.  (There are 6 answers. The 
first answer is 1210, your for loop coding should produce the other five answers)
```{r}
x<- c(11,13,17,19,23,29)

for (i in x) {
  print(i^(3)-i^(2))
}
```
